# Merchant Building Reactions:
# Merchant Commodities Building:
# A - so I wanted a basic necessities of Dwarf Society building - the goal was
# to not go overboard with what was available to dwarfs from a vendor.  at the 
# same time provide at least a place to sell off excess unwanted stones, fish, 
# meat, wood, etc. and provide some basic return of those at a higher price.
# in otherwords this shop is not a 1 for 1 returner but a 2 to 1 return.
